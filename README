IPDR

IPDR is a method to collect statistical data for a variety of IP applications.
Primarily this module ( two are contained in this distribtion ) focus on 
Cisco UBR ( 7200 and 10k ) and Motorola BSR 6400. The later module should also
work for any other IPDR compliant services.

Make sure you actually LOOK at the test results otherwise when running the module
strange results will occur if the test fails, even though the module will still
install.
